## Installation

Use "Install from URL" in the Extensions section of WebUI. 

## Notes

Some seldom used features have been removed from the UI. Such as the checkpoint and styles refresh buttons, and X/Y plot comparison scripts. To restore them, open style.css with notepad and remove the annotated code found at the end of the file. They are segmented so you can easily identify and remove the appropriate code if you want to pick and choose which of these features you want visible.
